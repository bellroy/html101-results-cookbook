<h2>Sweet Shortcrust Pastry</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 vanilla pod (seeds only)</li>
	<li>250g plain flour</li>
	<li>90g icing sugar</li>
	<li>125g butter (diced)</li>
	<li>1 large egg</li>
	<li>plain flour for dusting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds.</li>
	<li>Place the flour, icing sugar, vanilla seeds and butter in a food processor. Combine the using pulse mode until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs (this should not take more than 10 seconds). Add one egg into the mixture and pulse until the mixture starts to clump, just to the point where, if you hold some of the mixture between your fingers, it holds together.</li>
	<li>Dust your work surface with flour. Dump the crumbly dough on the work surface and begin bringing the mixture together. Do so only until it is a smooth ball, and be careful not to over-mix or the dough will become too hard. Now wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge to rest and cool for at least one hour.</li>
	<li>Take the pastry from the fridge and remove the cling film. Lightly dust the work surface with flour and knead the pastry for about 30 seconds to make it smooth again. Begin to roll out the pastry until it’s 3-4mm thick, making sure you turn it and flour it occasionally.</li>
	<li>Now roll the pastry over your rolling pin and unroll it over a 9 or 10 inch fluted tart tin*. Make sure you press the pastry into the corners of the tin using your fingers. Trim away excess pastry using a sharp knife, but leave some pastry hanging over the edge - this will be trimmed neatly after the tart is baked. Prick the base all over with a fork and place the tart shell in the fridge for about at least 30 minutes to an hour to allow the pastry to relax (and avoid shrinking).</li>
	<li>Remove the tart shell from the fridge. Place baking paper and baking beans in the tart shell and cook in a pre-heated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 15-20 mins. Remove the tart shell from the oven, remove the paper and beans, then put it back in the oven for 5 more minutes. Remove the tart shell and put it on a rack to cool. In the meantime, reduce the oven heat to 150°C (300°F).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lemon Filling</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>8 eggs</li>
	<li>300g caster sugar</li>
	<li>zest of 4 lemons</li>
	<li>juice of 4 lemons</li>
	<li>juice of 2 limes</li>
	<li>300ml creme fraiche</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Whisk the eggs, sugar, lemon zest and juice, and lime juice, in a medium sized bowl. Slowly pour in the cream and whisk together to combine.</li>
	<li>Pour the custard into the pie crust (it helps if you put the empty pie crust part-way into the oven before pouring in the custard to avoid spills).</li>
	<li>Cook the tart for 25-30 minutes, or until it is just set (there should be a slight wobble in the middle as it will continue to firm up as it cools).</li>
	<li>Remove the tray from the oven and place on a wire rack. Use a sharp paring knife to trim away the excess pastry around the top, then leave the tart to cool completely on a rack. If not eating right away, store the tart in the fridge, lightly covered with foil.</li>
</ol>
