	<h2> Austrian beef ribs with crunchy slaw - Serves 4</h2>
	<h3> Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> 1.5-2kg (3lb 5oz-4lb 8oz) beef short ribs (also known as Jacob’s ladder) </li>
	</ul>

	<h4> For the marinade </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> 1 x 400g tin cherry tomatoes, chopped</li>
		<li> 50g (1¾oz) dark brown sugar</li>
		<li> 1tbsp tomato purée</li>
		<li> 1 dried chipotle chilli, finely chopped (from supermarkets)</li>
		<li> 2tsp white pepper </li>
		<li> 100ml (3½fl oz) red wine vinegar </li>
		<li> 1tbsp fish sauce or Worcestershire sauce </li>
		<li> 5 cloves of garlic, peeled and minced </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>For the Slaw</h4>
	<ul>
		<li> 250g (9oz) celeriac, peeled</li>
		<li> 4 carrots, peeled </li>
		<li> 1 crunchy red dessert apple</li>
		<li> 150g (5½oz) crème fraîche</li>
		<li> 4tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
		<li> 1tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
		<li> A pinch of caster sugar</li>
		<li> Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

		<li>2 spring onions, finely chopped, to garnish the ribs</li>
	</ul>

	<h4> Method</h4>
	<p> Put all the marinade ingredients into a bowl and mix well. Place the ribs with the marinade in a large bag to
		marinate for at least an hour (several hours or overnight is best). </p>
	<p> Preheat the oven to 170°C/fan 150°C/gas 3. Remove the ribs and the marinade from the bag and put into a large
		tray. </p>
	<P> Cover with foil and roast for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart. Increase the
		oven temperature to 220°C/fan 200°C/gas 7. Remove the foil and baste the ribs with the marinade.</P>
	<p> Roast for a further 30 minutes, basting another couple of times. The sauce should be sticky and thick, and the
		ribs dark and glossy. Remove from the oven and leave to cool until you can pick them up with your fingers.</p>
	<p> If you want to thicken the sauce further, remove the ribs, cover them in foil and set aside. Place the sauce in
		a small saucepan and simmer until it’s the desired consistency, then brush over the ribs before serving. </p>
	<p> Meanwhile, make the coleslaw. Cut the celeriac and carrots into fine matchsticks, or grate them. A mandolin or
		food processor works well for this. Peel and core the apple, then slice into matchsticks or grate.</p>
	<p> Place all the salad ingredients into a bowl. Whisk together the rest of the slaw ingredients and toss through
		the salad. Taste for seasoning then line the ribs up, sprinkle with the chopped spring onions down the middle
		and serve with the slaw on the side.</p>
