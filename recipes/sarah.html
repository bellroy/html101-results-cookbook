	<h1> Sarah's Pancakes </h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li> 2 eggs </li>
			<li> 1 3/4 cup milk </li>
			<li> 1 tsp vanilla essence </li>
			<li> 2 cups self-raising flour </li>
			<li> 1/3 cup caster sugar </li>
			<li> 1 tsp butter </li>
			<li> Maple syrup </li>
		</ul>
	</p>


	<h2> Step 1</h2>

	<p>Whisk eggs, milk and vanilla together in a jug. Sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Make a well in the
		centre. Add milk mixture. Whisk until just combined.</p>

		cup mixture per pancake, cook 2 pancakes for 2 minutes or until bubbles appear on surface. Turn and cook for a
		further 1-2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat
		with remaining mixture, greasing pan with butter or cooking oil between batches.
